# Good today.
Name's Nick. I mostly do design thingies, change my website and branding every other week, and drink coffee.

And I also like to write angry commit messages.

## Current focus:
Rewriting [my website with Next.js](https://github.com/pprmint/pprmint.art-Next) and hosting it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
