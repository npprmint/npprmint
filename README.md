# Good today.
Welcome to my Github profile. So far the only thing you can do here is [look at the source code for my website](https://github.com/pprmint/pprmint.de). Maybe it helps some to get started with creating their own website, or just laugh at how trash my code is and how wrong I'm doing some things in React.\
If one day I get myself to write code for something other than my website, like an app or something, of course that will also be available here. Meanwhile, enjoy what's there and have a good one.
