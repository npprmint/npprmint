# Good today.
Name's Nick. I do stuff with vectors, polygons and code. That's my funny way of saying I make vector and 3D graphics and have a website.

## Current focus.
Building [my website](https://github.com/pprmint/pprmint.art-Next) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [next-intl](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), hosting it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

- WIP Next.js + Tailwind site: [tw.pprmint.art](https://tw.pprmint.art)
- Public Next.js + MUI site: [pprmint.art](https://pprmint.art)
- Legacy React + MUI site: [old.pprmint.art](https://old.pprmint.art)

I may potentially turn [ppr.one](https://ppr.one/) in a link shortener some day.

Also working on two other websites that are not yet made public. But they look cool.
