# Good today.
Name's Nick. I do stuff with vectors, polygons and code. That's my funny way of saying I make vector and 3D graphics and have a website.

## Current focus.
Building [my website](https://github.com/pprmint/pprmint.art-Next) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [next-intl](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), hosting it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

- WIP Next.js + Tailwind site: [tw.pprmint.art](https://tw.pprmint.art)
- Public Next.js + MUI site: [pprmint.art](https://pprmint.art)
- Legacy React + MUI site: [old.pprmint.art](https://old.pprmint.art)

I may potentially turn [ppr.one](https://ppr.one/) in a link shortener some day.

I'm also working on two other websites for my friends, but they're not ready for the public yet. If you want to look at broken and unfinished websites, go to my own.
